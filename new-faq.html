<h3><a name="what">What We Do</a></h3>
Learning Technics treats the neurological causes of learning difficulties by growing new neurological tissue in areas of weakness

<h3><a name="treat">Difficulties We Treat</a></h3>
We have treated thousands of students with a wide range of problems. This treatment has taken place over a twenty-year period at locations not only in the U.S., but also internationally.

<h3><a name="age">Age Range</a></h3>
We work with students four years of age and above. Twenty percent of our students are adults.

<h3><a name="how">Student Success</a></h3>
We are the most successful with students who have normal or above normal intelligence, but who have been unable to turn teaching into learning. This can include students who are losing hope of getting an adequate education and students with poor self-esteem.

<h3><a name="expect">Expected Results</a></h3>
Studies have shown an average of two-years improvement in six months’ time. This is accompanied by a major improvement in behavior.
