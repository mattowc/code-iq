<h3><a name="what"></a>1. What We Do</h3>
IQ Express treats the neurological causes of learning difficulties by growing new neurological tissue in areas of weakness.
<h3><a name="treat"></a>2. How can one product help so many different disorders?</h3>
Developmental skills are interactive skills between the brain and the body, which normally develop as an individual experiences and grows throughout childhood.  When these skills do not develop, there is a weak base for the continuation of higher learning.  

Physio-Neuro Therapy is a program comprised of a series of developmentally specific exercises designed to bring these poorly developed skills to an appropriate level for the age and maturity of the student. These activities are designed to create a stronger base on which the student may build the learning skills necessary for success in a scholastic setting.
<h3><a name="age"></a>3. Age Range</h3>
We work with students four years of age and above. Twenty percent of our students are adults.
<h3><a name="how"></a>4. Student Success</h3>
We are the most successful with students who have normal or above normal intelligence, but who have been unable to turn teaching into learning. This can include students who are losing hope of getting an adequate education and students with poor self-esteem.
<h3><a name="expect"></a>5. Expected Results</h3>
Studies have shown an average of two-years improvement in six months’ time. This is accompanied by a major improvement in behavior.
